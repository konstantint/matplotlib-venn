Venn diagram plotting routines.
Math for computing with venn diagram regions.

The current logic of drawing the venn diagram is the following:
 - Position the circles.
 - Compute the regions of the diagram based on circles
 - Compute the position of the label within each region.
 - Create matplotlib PathPatch or Circle objects for each of the regions.

This module contains functionality necessary for the second, third and fourth steps of this process.

Note that the regions of an up to 3-circle Venn diagram may be of the following kinds:
 - No region
 - A circle
 - A 2, 3 or 4-arc "poly-arc-gon".  (I.e. a polygon with up to 4 vertices, that are connected by circle arcs)
 - A set of two 3-arc-gons.

We create each of the regions by starting with a circle, and then either intersecting or subtracting the second and the third circles.
The classes below implement the region representation, the intersection/subtraction procedures and the conversion to matplotlib patches.
In addition, each region type has a "label positioning" procedure assigned.

        Given a circular region, compute two new regions:
        one obtained by subtracting the circle from this region, and another obtained by intersecting the circle with the region.

        In all implementations it is assumed that the circle to be subtracted is not completely within
        the current region without touching its borders, i.e. it will not form a "hole" when subtracted.

        Arguments:
           center (tuple):  A two-element tuple-like, representing the coordinates of the center of the circle.
           radius (float):  A nonnegative number, the radius of the circle.

        Returns:
           a list with two elements - the result of subtracting the circle, and the result of intersecting with the circle.
