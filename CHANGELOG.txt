Version 0.11.9
--------------

    - Minor update to metadata (mark Development Status as Stable).

Version 0.11.8
--------------

    - Added pyproject.toml (Issue #71).

Version 0.11.7
--------------

    - Fixed Travis-CI-related error messages.

Version 0.11.6
--------------

    - Added matplotlib_venn.__version__ field (Issue #59).

Version 0.11.5
--------------

    - Added subset_label_formatter parameter (PR#28)

Version 0.11.4
--------------

    - Added support for Counter objects (PR#26)
    
Version 0.11.3
--------------

    - Tiny change in README required a version bump to upload it to PyPi.

Version 0.11.2
--------------

    - Fixes issue #24
    - Addresses Debian bug #813782

Version 0.11
------------

    - Fixed issue #17. This would change the previous layout of circles in certain pathological cases.

Version 0.10
------------

    - Completely rewritten the region generation logic, presumably fixing all of the problems behind issue #14
      (and hopefully not introducing too many new bugs). The new algorithm positions the labels in a different way,
      which may look slightly worse than the previous one in some rare cases.
    - New kind of IPython-based tests.

Version 0.9
-----------

    - Better support for weird special cases in Venn3 (i.e. one circle being completely inside another, issue #10).

Version 0.8
-----------

    - Added support for Python 3.

Version 0.7
-----------

    - Added the possibility to provide sets (rather than subset sizes) to venn2 and venn3
      Thanks to https://github.com/aebrahim
    - Functions won't bail out on sets of size 0 now (the diagrams won't look pretty, though)
      Thanks to https://github.com/olgabot
    - Venn2/Venn3 objects now provide information about the coordinates and radii of the circles.
    - Utility functions added for drawing unweighed diagrams (venn2_unweighted, venn3_unweighted)
    - Labels for zero-size sets can be switched off using a method of VennDiagram.
    - Some general code refactoring.

Version 0.6
-----------

    - Added "ax" keyword to the plotting routines to specify the axes object on which the diagram will be created.
      Thanks goes to https://github.com/sinhrks

Version 0.5
-----------

    - Fixed a bug (issue 1, "unreferenced variable 's'" in venn2 and venn2_circles)

Version 0.4
-----------

    - Fixed a bug ("ValueError: to_rgba: Invalid rgba arg" when specifying lighter set colors)

Version 0.3
-----------

    - Changed package name from `matplotlib.venn` to `matplotlib_venn`.
    - Fixed up some places to comply with pep8 lint checks.

Version 0.2
-----------

    - Changed parameterization of venn3 and venn3_circles (now expects 7-element vectors as arguments rather than 8-element).
    - 2-set venn diagrams (functions venn2 and venn2_circles)
    - Added support for non-intersecting sets ("Euler diagrams")
    - Minor fixes here and there.

Version 0.1
-----------

    - Initial version, three-circle area-weighted venn diagrams.
